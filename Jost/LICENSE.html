        <h2>SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE</h2>

        <p>Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</p>
        <p>PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
          development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
          efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
          open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
          with others.</p>
        <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed
          freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including
          any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold
          with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative
          works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any
          other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license
          does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
        <p>DEFINITIONS "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the
          Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This
          may include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>
        <p>"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
          as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</p>
        <p>"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
          or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the Original
          Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.</p>
        <p>"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer
          or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>
