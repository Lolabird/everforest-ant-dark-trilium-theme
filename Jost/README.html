          />Jost* is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired
          by the 1920s German sans-serifs. This is version 3.5.</p>
        <p>Jost* is designed and maintained by <a href="https://ewonrael.github.io/">Owen Earl</a>,
          who is the creator of the font foundry <a href="http://indestructible-type.github.io">indestructible type*</a>.</p>
        
<h3>About</h3>

        <p>During the 1920s there was a radical shift in German sans serif letterforms.
          A marriage between the precise geometry of earlier German sans serifs with
          the clean legibility of the humanists coming out of England, yielded a
          geometric sans serif that is so iconic that it still looks as futuristic
          and forward- thinking as it did almost 100 years ago. Jost* is an ode to
          this era of type design. Instead of trying to recreate it precisely, Jost*
          aims to capture the spirit, using the technologies of today.</p>
        <p>Jost* has 9 weights, ranging from Hairline to Black. It can support many
          languages, includes stylistic alternatives, and both tabular and proportional
          numbers. Using Jost* on the web is as easy as copying a line of code into
          your webpage and includes automatic updates. As of version 3.0, Jost* supports
          OpenType Variable Font technology that allows users to control the exact
          weight and italic of the font. Best of all Jost* is still being actively
          developed meaning it will continue to improve and future updates may include
          features requested by you! <a href="http://indestructibletype.com/Jost">Visit the website for more information!</a>

          functoning version of this font requires a payment of $10 or more on the
